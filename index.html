            <h1>Joining the program</h1>
            <p>After studying comp1531, I found developing website satisfying and interesting, seeing the progress of they outcome of codes. So I wanted to continue building coding and developing skills and I think this program is the best place to do so with team leaders guiding throughout the process. Hence, its easier to get supported through the learning journey and I'll be able to learn it better.</p>
            <p>The other reason is to meet people that are also interested in developing and programming. I think its easier for me to learn something consistently if I know people are also learning it at the same time. And I can also learn more about coding and developing if I’m able to discuss with it someone. Hence, I think joining this program is a good opportunity for me to achieve my goal of improving programming skills and figure if developing is the career I wanted after graduating.</p>

            <h1>Commitments</h1>
            <p>I have participated a few projects internally and externally, I understand my responsibilities and I have been able commit my part in the past. In a recent digital marketing project I participated in, I ensure to not neglect my duties by telling teammates my availabilities, setting deadline for tasks and double checking if all the tasks are completed before the deadline. These help to ensure I fulfilled my duties and improved my teamwork skill as understanding each other’s availabilities increase team communication efficiency.</p>
            <p>In the last term, I’ve also enhanced my time management, self-learning and teamwork skills through actively participating in COMP1531 project. This project has a fixed deadlines and require a high level of self-learning skill. My team managed to complete the tasks before the deadline while I actively learning and practicing new ways of making the code more efficient. Throughout this process, I learnt where I should get coding support from and websites that assist me learning new code. I believe with this experience, I’m capable of completing my task on time and learn new developing skills during the project. </p>

            <h1>Oatmeal VS friend</h1>
            <p>I have searched on google a bit and found people can live with solely oatmeal as food, hence physically speaking, I will not die from only eating oatmeal. So I think the main factor of this decision depends on whether I rely on food or friend for emotional support. My first instinct was to kill my closest friend since I really like trying different food and love food so much. </p>
            <p>But on a second thought, assuming my closest friend means a very unique people that I can share everything with and there is no other replacement in my life, I might choose to eat oatmeal for the rest of my life. I remember reading or watching some books or news talking about depression being a surging issue in the world as people rely more on tech, the main idea of that info was saying human need to be socially connect to survive. So in other words, killing my closest friend means that I will not have a really good channel to share my feelings and thoughts, which also means that I have a higher risk of getting mental health disorder. That these may imply I'll be at risk of physical health condition or risk of earlier death. </p>
            <p>With this, instead of having a double lose condition emotionally and physically for choosing killing my best friend. I’ll choose to eat oatmeal for the rest of my life.</p>
